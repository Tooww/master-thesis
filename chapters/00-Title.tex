Motivation: Before dive into this master thesis. For a better comprehension I want to explain a bit my motivation, my vision, my goal about the work I have done during my master. The goal was first learning a lot of new hard skill in a way that it can be used for to create a new vision of what is technology. Particularly In a word where we start to feel the consequence -- and paradoxically the need -- of less energy and resource.
