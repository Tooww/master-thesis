        Motivation: Before diving into this master's thesis, I want to explain a bit about my motivation, vision, and goals regarding the work I have done during my master's. The goal was to learn many new hard skills in a way that can be used to create a new vision of technology, particularly in a world where we start to feel the consequences—and paradoxically the need—for less energy and resources.
