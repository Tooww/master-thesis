\section{Context}
Science in this field relatively new. The starting point differs depending on how we define biomaterials definition and how make, or rather grow them. 
More globally, biomaterials are at the crossroads of many fields of scientific and even artistic research. From agriculture to design, from synthetic biology to fashion, from DIY fermented drink to biohacking in the kintchen.

As matter of fact, the starting point might be the first crops domestication. At this time the goal was only to produce food, and the process were optimized by selective breeding. By taking the plants with the biggest fruit or the best resistance to environment, from generation to generation plants were "optimized" for the population.
Besides, the use of wood are very use in numerous sectors\cite{ramage2017wood} push by international directive of less CO2 emmission and waste. 

However, today biomaterials
