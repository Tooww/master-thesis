This thesis explores the impact of gamified interfaces on learning and performance in the fields of music theory, singing, theremin, and sign language. By integrating augmented reality and tangible interfaces, the study is guided by principles from gamification, performance psychology, and multiple intelligences theory. The research yields valuable insights into optimizing engagement and enhancing information retention through these interfaces.

The presented projects include an interactive musical score, an American Sign Language learning game, and applications for singing and theremin practice. Each project employs innovative approaches to render complex subjects appealing while upholding teaching effectiveness. Future endeavors include refining these projects to further elevate user engagement and information retention, contributing to the ongoing evolution of enhanced learning interfaces.
