\section{Context}

In the field of material science, Plastics have been booming since the late 1950s\cite{geyer2017production}
It's a problem for ecosystems, on one hand, by the means of production as 90\% of plastics come from fossil fuels. On other hand,
because of its widespread presence in ecosystems gradually degraded into microplastics and nanoplastics.
Moreover only 9\% of plastics is recycled and 12\% is incinerated almost all other waste is lost in nature.\cite{natureeditorial} 

With plastics, we have a material that our environments can't dissolve and similarly as a a living organism
